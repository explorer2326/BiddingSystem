# COMPGC06_BiddingSystem

This project is aiming at delivering an auction system that allow users to post item and bid on items. HTML, bootstrap, CSS and JavaScript are used for the front-end development and PHP and MySQL are used during the back-end development.
We used an online template as our web app UI design and the whole web app can be divided into 4 main parts depends on their functions: 1. Login and register, 2. Userâ€™s personal dashboard where they can manage their auction and account, 3. Item browse page, where users can browse items, search for particular items or sort items based on categories. 4. Single item page, where users can bid on items and write feedback on the item.
